      <h3 id="headline">Here's a timeline of Guy Debord's life:</h3>
      <ul class="timeline-list">

            towards the conscious and
            collective establishment of a
            new civilization'</i></li>
        <li class="timeline-list__item"><strong>1956</strong> -
          Debord and Wolman publish a fundamental text: <i>'How to use the hijacking'</i>. The Lettrist International is now radically different from Isletic Lettrism, developing a theoretical work that will soon lead to the creation of the
          Situationist International.
          Much of the former Lettrist vanguard, remaining with Isou and Lemaitre, decides not to follow Debord in what she considers a political deviation and will continue to develop independently of the Lettrist International.
        </li>
        <li class="timeline-list__item"><strong>1957</strong> - the Letterist International, the International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus, and the London Psychogeographical Association gathered in Cosio d'Arroscia (Cuneo), Italy, to found the
          Situationist International,
          with Debord having been the leading representative of the Letterist delegation</li>
        <li class="timeline-list__item"><strong>1958</strong> - 'SI' raid against an international art conference in Belgium</li>
        <li class="timeline-list__item"><strong>1959</strong> - Debord 'meeting the group of intellectuals and revolutionary workers <i>'Socialisme ou Barbarie'</i></li>

        <li class="timeline-list__item"><strong>1967</strong> - Writes his famous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Society_of_the_Spectacle" target="_blank"><i>'Society of Spectacle'</i></a> which explained the nature of late capitalism's
          historical
          decay that along with Mustapha Khayati's 'On the Poverty of Student
          Life'
          becomes catalyst for the future
          uprising
          in France</li>
        <li class="timeline-list__item"><strong>1968</strong> - Led Situationist International group, later takes part in the occupation of Sorbonne</li>
        <li class="timeline-list__item"><strong>1970</strong> - Debord's life became more and more nomadic: he stayed, according to the seasons, between Paris, Auvergne and Tuscany, his stays in Italy, in particular, allow him to observe closely
          counter-insurgency that a modern state is able to lead in the context of the resurgence of proletarian subversion; in this explosive context, in every sense of the term, years of lead, he continues to fight with Gianfranco Sanguinetti,
          former situationist of the second Italian section with whom he builds a long friendship.
          He also became a close associate of Gérard Lebovici , who financed three of his films.
        </li>

        <li class="timeline-list__item"><strong>1972</strong> -
          Debord exerts an influence more and more on <i>'Free Field'</i> , the publishing house of Gerard Lebovici who publishes it. Debord published authors he considers important: Gracian , Clausewitz , August Cieszkowski, Anacharsis Cloots, Bruno
          Rizzi, Edward Sexby without assuming an official position in the new editorial line of this atypical editor. The strategic aim of Gerard Lebovici and Guy Debord through Free Field is to highlight the appearance of things to better reveal
          the reality. It is a work of deprogramming, counter-information, demystification, of which <i>'Free Field'</i> is the essential vector. The aim is to react to the deadly general alienation, to the media conditioning of the individual, to
          the general lack of general culture, to the temptation to exclude from the history of the exciting moments of art and life, and more generally to the degradation of the quality of existence.</i>
        <li class="timeline-list__item"><strong>1972</strong> - Debord disbanded the Situationist International after its original members, including Asger Jorn and Raoul Vaneigem, quit or were expelled.</li>

          Debord rented an apartment in Seville, where he wrote a text that will be published in <i>'Appeals of the prison of Segovia'</i> to release Spanish insurgents.</li>
        <li class="timeline-list__item"><strong>1994</strong> - Debord committed suicide by shooting himself on 30 November</li>
        <li class="timeline-list__item"><strong>2009</strong> - On 29 January, fifteen years after his death, Christine Albanel, Minister of Culture, classified the archive of his works as a <i>'national treasure'</i> in response to a sale request by
          Yale University. The
          Ministry
          declared that 'he has been one of the most important contemporary thinkers, with a capital place in history of ideas from the second half of the twentieth century.' Similarly, Debord once called his book,
          The Society of the Spectacle, <i>'the most important book of the twentieth century'</i>. He continues to be a canonical and controversial figure particularly among European scholars of radical politics and modern art.</li>
        <li class="timeline-list__item"><strong>2009</strong> -
          The National Library of France signed in March 2010 an agreement with <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Becker-Ho">Alice Becker-Ho</a> for the purchase of these archives
